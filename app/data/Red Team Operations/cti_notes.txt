The containers may take some time to start up for the first time, please be patient.
Configure Integration
In order to integrate MISP and Cortex with TheHive, the API keys from both platforms must be added
to the configuration file. This will outline how to work through that process.

Cortex
Login to Cortex using it’s address found in the table above. The first time accessing Cortex will prompt
for updating the database, click “update database”. Next, create an administrator user, an organization,
and another user (remember to set password) and create an API key to use with the TheHive.
Once the API key is obtained, place the key in the correct location in TheHive’s application.conf
Note: Make sure the current working directory is set to ~/Docker-Templates/docker/thehive4-
cortex3-misp-shufle

nano thehive/application.conf

}
11
(...)
MISP
Login to MISP using it’s address and credentials found in the table above. Go to “My Profile” where
there will be an “Auth Keys” item. There, create a new API key and note this key as it will no longer be
accessible in clear text once the window is closed.
Once the API key is obtained, place the key in the correct location in TheHive’s application.conf
Note: Make sure the current working directory is set to ~/Docker-Templates/docker/thehive4-
cortex3-misp-shufle

Restart Services
Afer configuration, the containers should be restarted. To do so, press CTRL + C on the active terminal
to stop the containers gracefully. Afer the containers have stopped, re-run the command to start the
containers.
Note: Make sure the current working directory is set to (...)/Docker-Templates/docker/thehive4-
cortex3-misp-shufle
1
# Start conatiners
2
sudo /usr/local/bin/docker-compose up
Both MISP and Cortex are now integrated with TheHive and this can be confirmed by pressing the
“About” button in the sub-menu located at the top right corner of TheHive’s web UI.
Both services should report their status as “OK”
